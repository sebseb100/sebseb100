- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sebseb100 and I love to program in Python!
- I started to program after taking a few online courses on Udemy and Coursera.
- I then started to tackle exercise sets like those found on codingbat.com to strengthen my skills. 
- Shortly after I started to tackle bigger projects using Python Libraries.
- I've created games like Connect Four, Tic Tac Toe, and a basic Tetris
- I've done data analysis projects on Crypto Price Movements, Air Quality, and Crime 
- Now I'm working on creating my own Crypto-Currency called Dono
